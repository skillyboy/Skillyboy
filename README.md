About Me

Hi! I'm Fakorede Abbas, a dedicated full-stack software engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria.

I am also experienced in deploying scalable applications on cloud platforms like AWS. My passion lies in leveraging technology to build innovative solutions that drive positive change, especially in areas like energy, utilities, and fintech.
